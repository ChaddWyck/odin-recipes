        <h4>Preparation instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large pot or 
                Dutch oven over medium heat. Season the sausage 
                and chicken pieces with half of the Cajun 
                seasoning.</li>
            <li>Brown sausage in the hot oil; remove with slotted 
                spoon and set aside. Add remaining oil to the pot 
                and sauté chicken until lightly browned. Remove 
                with slotted spoon; set aside.</li>
            <li>Sauté the onion, bell pepper and celery until 
                onion is soft and transparent.  Add the garlic 
                and cook until fragrant (30 seconds).</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomatoes; season with salt, pepper, 
                thyme, oregano, red pepper flakes (or Cayenne 
                powder), hot pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce, 
                and the remaining Cajun seasoning. Stir chicken 
                and sausage. Cook for 5 minutes, while stirring 
                occasionally.</li>
            <li>Add in the rice and chicken broth, bring to a boil, 
                then reduce heat to low-medium. Cover and let simmer 
                for about 20 to 25 minutes, or until liquid is 
                absorbed and rice is cooked, while stirring 
                occasionally.</li>
            <li>Place the shrimp on top of the Jambalaya mixture, 
                stir through gently and cover with lid. Allow to 
                simmer while stirring occasionally, until the shrimp 
                are cooked through and pink (about 5-6 minutes, 
                depending on the size/thickness of the shrimp being 
                used).</li>
            <li>Season with a little extra salt and pepper if needed 
                and remove from heat. Adjust heat with extra hot sauce, 
                Cayenne pepper or Cajun seasoning. Serve immediately 
                with sliced green onions and parsley.</li>
