            <li>2 stalks celery, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>3 cups water</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch garlic salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon browning sauce (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Preparation instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place roast in a large baking pan; arrange potatoes, 
                onion, carrots, and celery around roast. Pour 3 cups 
                water into baking pan. Season roast with salt, pepper, 
                and garlic salt. Cover pan with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until roast is browned and 
                cooked through, about 3 hours. An instant-read 
                thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the roast 
                should read 145 degrees F (65 degrees C). Transfer 
                roast to an oven-safe platter. Remove vegetables using 
                a slotted spoon and arrange around roast.</li>
            <li>Reduce oven temperature to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). 
                Place platter with roast and vegetables in the oven to 
                keep warm.</li>
            <li>Pour the remaining juices from the baking pan into a 
                saucepan; bring to a boil. Stir 1/2 cup water and 
                cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth; pour into 
                boiling pan juices. Reduce heat to medium; cook, stirring 
                constantly, until gravy is thick, about 5 minutes; season 
                with salt and pepper. Stir in browning sauce.</li>
        </ol>
